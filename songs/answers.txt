If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A: People liked energy and dance music with neutral mood. Close to the "Orange" in Spotify terms.
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A: It averages all titles, mixing different time of a day, listeners mood etc.
