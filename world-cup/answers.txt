Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Brazil and Portugal moved down after increasing simulations to 10000 and above

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I'd stop on 100000 simulations, it stabilizes results between runnings and difference is close to 0.1%
